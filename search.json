    "text": "1.1 Why agent-based models are useful\nAgent-based models (ABMs) provide a structured way to explore complex systems by simulating interactions between autonomous agents, i.e., simulated people. In sustainability contexts, ABMs offer a low-cost testbed for understanding how interventions might impact social dynamics and environmental outcomes. For example, Airoldi and Christakis (2024) demonstrated through regression analysis across that one method for selecting individuals targeted in a public health education campaign resulted in In other worlds, we can use ABMs to deduce how different learning rules, group identities, and social structures shape sustainability outcomes.\nA typical ABM simulation cycle includes (Figure 1.2):\nWe will analyze and draw on several real-world empirical studies of interventions to develop our agent-based models that we in turn will use to simulate interventions in order to deduce which strategies are most effective for social interventions to promote sustainability, and why. A social intervention (or just intervention) for promoting sustainability is any concerted effort where those promoting a sustainable practice introduces information about how to perform that practice to a population. Deductive methods complement _i strategies are most effective and why in idealized, cost-free settings (cost-free at least compared to the cost of real-world social interventions at scale). Our empirically-motivated models The cognitive and social factors we identify are suitable for inclusion in agent-based models of social behavior that we use to deduce the emergent social outcomes we can expect from different strategies for social interventions to promote sustainable practices.\nLow-cost experimentation with simulated social interventions to promote sustainability are critical. Unless progress is accelerated towards we can expect to “have 575 million people living in extreme poverty, 600 million people facing hunger, and 84 million children and young people out of school. Humanity will overshoot the Paris climate agreement’s 1.5°C ‘safe’ guardrail on…temperature rise. And, at the current rate, it will take 300 years to attain gender equality” (Malekpour et al. 2023, 250). Accelerated transformations are required to reach goals necessary to avoid increasingly frequent and costly climate change disasters (United Nations 2023). It is not plausible to do real-world experiments at the global scale required to infer which strategies work best in which situations.\nIn this course we will focus on deducing how between different cognitive and social factors, or other initial conditions, affect simulated sustainability intervention outcomes. We will frame our studies in terms of sustainable development goals, but we will never fit our models to observations. Nonetheless, we will strive to develop models that are amenable to real-world interventions against which the models could be fit and predictions could be compared. It seems this is not done too much in practice yet in sustainability. However, some of our colleagues focused on studying basic processes that underlie cultural transmission do exactly this to explain experimental data and archaeological observations (Deffner et al. 2024), which thereby improves their theory, models, and understanding of cultural evolution in a theory-model-observation cycle. With more time and research effort, this cycle may become commonplace in sustainability.\nThe urgent need to understand how sustainable behaviors spread in order to develop effective interventions pressures social scientists to make social science more rigorous, reliable, and digestible by non-social scientists. In the rest of this Introduction we review cognitive and social theories of social learning, identity and influence, homophily and core-periphery network structures, and preview the remainder of the course material.

    "section": "1.2 Social learning strategies",
    "text": "1.2 Social learning strategies\nHuman kind is set apart by powerful learning and reasoning capabilities (Witt et al. 2024) that enable cultural transmission and accumulation of technologies and practices no other species matches (Henrich 2015). For our sustainability models, we only need simple models of cognition and learning. It would never be practical to do psychological or cognitive tests in the context of sustainability interventions that targets large populations, for one thing, so we could never compare detailed cognitive assumptions or predictions with reality. For our purposes we will consider three general classes of learning strategy:\n\nContagion: Individuals copy behaviors simply by observing others performing them.\nFrequency-biased learning: Individuals adopt behaviors because others are already doing them, creating a conformity effect.\nSuccess-biased learning: Individuals are more likely to adopt behaviors perceived to be successful or beneficial.\n\nIn the mangrove versus seawall example, success-biased learning might favor seawalls if influential external actors, who seem successful or wealthy, advocate for them, even if seawalls are ultimately less effective. Mangrove forests might become widely adopted if, on the other hand, frequency-biased learning predominates and many communities have adopted that method.\n\n1.2.1 Formal social learning models with example\nTo make this more concrete, we formalize (i.e., give formulas for) these three learning strategies as follows using the example in Figure 1.3. In the example, there is one focal agent who is the one doing the observing/learning, labelled with the ID 1, and three social network neighbors with IDs 2, 3, and 4. The focal agent is deciding whether or not to install residential solar. One of his neighbors has installed it, 2. Based on 1’s perception, 2 is the wealthiest, represented by four dollar symbols. 3 is perceived to have one dollar and 4 has two dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Agent 1, the focal agent, is considering whether to install residential solar. The probability agent 1 installs residential solar depends on its social learning strategy.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1.1 Contagion learning\nIn the contagion learning model, the focal agent’s (i.e., the learner’s) teacher (i.e., interaction partner) is chosen at random. Then, the learner adopts the teacher’s behavior with probability \\(\\alpha\\), the adoption rate. In this case, then, the probability that 1 adopts residential solar is\n\\[\n\\Pr(1 \\text{ adopts solar}) = \\alpha \\Pr(1 \\text{ selects 2 as teacher}) = \\alpha \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\nMore generally, for focal agent \\(i\\) with the set of neighbors \\(n_i\\) (\\(n_1 = \\{2, 3, 4\\}\\) in the example), where \\(m_i\\) is the set of neighbors who have adopted the adaptive behavior (\\(m_i = \\{2\\}\\) in the example). We call the adaptive behavior \\(A\\). The general probability of adoption in contagion learning is therefore\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{\\alpha |m_i|}{|n_i|},\n\\]\nwhere the \\(| \\cdot |\\) operator counts the number of elements in a set.\n\n\n1.2.1.2 Frequency-biased learning\nIn frequency-biased learning there is no interaction partner or teacher chosen. The probability of adoption is only given by the relative frequency of each behavior. The general expression is\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{|m_i|}{|n_i|}.\n\\]\nIn our example, then, the probability of installing residential solar under frequency-biased learning is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n\n1.2.1.3 Success-biased learning\nIn success-biased learning, learners first choose an interaction partner/teacher randomly weighted by observed fitness of their neighbors, which is a generic term for wealth, power, status, etc. In general for this case, the probability that learner \\(i\\) chooses teacher \\(j\\) is\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ chooses } j) = \\frac{f_j}{\\sum_{k \\in n_i} f_k}.\n\\]\nThe probability that \\(i\\) adopts \\(A\\) is then the sum of the probabilities of choosing each neighbor performing \\(A\\) (contained in the set \\(m_i\\)),\n\\[\n\\Pr(i \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in m_i} f_j}{\\sum_{k \\in n_i} f_k}.\n\\]\nIn our example, only one neighbor installed residential solar with a fitness (i.e. wealth in this example) of 4, while the others have finess 1 and 2. Therefore, \\(\\Pr(1 \\text{ adopts } A) = \\frac{4}{7}\\).\n\n\n1.2.1.4 Combinations of learning models\nThere is no reason different learning models cannot be combined. The software we will use in this class, socmod, provides flexibility to the user to define their own learning models. The simplest combination of the three learning models above is to add an adoption rate to either frequency- or success-biased learning. In this approach, one could call the behavior selected by the models above could be considered prospective or candidate behavior to learn, then is actually learned with probability \\(\\alpha\\).\nFor another potentially useful modification, \\(\\alpha\\) could be defined at the individual level, say \\(\\alpha_i\\), or for dyads (i.e., a pair of interacting individuals) , \\(\\alpha_{ij}\\), where \\(i\\) is still the focal agent learner, but we have added \\(j\\), representing the selected teacher.",

    "section": "1.3 Identity and Influence",
    "text": "1.3 Identity and Influence\nGroup identity critically influences social learning. Neuroscience research demonstrates that our brains distinctly respond to individuals identified as part of our group (Cikara and Van Bavel 2014), as revealed through fMRI neural imaging (Figure 1.4). This ability likely evolved because when humans first emerged about two million years ago, it was much more important for survival to be able to rapidly identify whether someone was a friend or foe based on group markers. Although group membership can affect how we respond to information learned from others, group membership itself is quite plastic, meaning who belongs to which group can be rapidly reconfigured. For example, neural signals of race-based group perception was observed to be suppressed and overridden when individuals were in mixed-race groups created by experimenters that competed against other mixed-race groups in an psychological experimental task (Van Bavel, Packer, and Cunningham 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Figure 1 reorganized with original caption from Cikara and Van Bavel (2014)\n\n\n\nStudies further show that group identity can strongly influence behavioral choices. For instance, experimental evidence reveals people resist adopting beneficial behaviors if associated with opposing political identities (Ehret et al. 2022), emphasizing how identity can create substantial barriers to sustainability. This general effect of group membership interfering with learning is called outgroup aversion (Paul E. Smaldino et al. 2017).",

    "text": "1.4 Social networks, homophily, and core-periphery structure\nSocial structure can significantly impact behavioral diffusion, especially in core-periphery configurations. Core-periphery networks emerge as a response to risk and uncertainty, e.g., in food sharing networks (Ready and Power 2018), so they are hypothesized to also be important in climate change adaptation transmission networks (Jones, Ready, and Pisor 2021). Core-periphery networks can be created by setting appropriate group sizes and homophily levels in homophily network models (Turner, Singleton, et al. 2023) or specifying certain connectivity probabilities to the stochastic block matrix algorithm for creating structured random graphs (Rombach et al. 2014; Milzman and Moser 2023). Homophily is the measure of how much more likely an individual is to socially connect within their own group versus with a member of a different group. Homophily can range from -1 to +1, where -1 represents no within-group connections and only between-group connections (i.e., anti-homophily); 0 represents an equal probability of within- and between-group connections, and +1 represents only within-group connections. We will define homophily as either a global or group-level variable, though homophily could vary individually as well. There are two types of homophily:\n\nChoice Homophily: Individuals actively prefer interacting with similar others.\nInduced Homophily: Social interactions limited by historical or external conditions like geography, profession, birthplace, etc.\n\nThese structural elements can significantly limit the diffusion of sustainable practices from peripheries, like the mangrove management on smaller islands, to central cores. However, as colleagues and I have showed, this core-periphery structure, defined by moderately high majority-group homophily can actually promote the diffusion of adaptations, provided the adaptation is practiced by the minority group (Turner, Singleton, et al. 2023), as is the case for mangrove forest management or prescribed burns. Formal definitions of homophily and core-peripheriness will be given in the networks chapter.",

    "text": "1.5 Course outline in the context of sustainable development\nThe agent-based modeling approach developed in this course provides a structured way to test the effectiveness of social interventions aimed at promoting sustainable behavior. By formalizing and testing our assumptions about social dynamics, agent-based modeling supports better design and evaluation of policies and programs aimed at driving real-world change. This deductive, experimental approach allows us to explore how cooperation, coordination, identity, homophily, and influence affect the likelihood that beneficial behaviors will spread. In the coming chapters and associated problem sets we will analyze social learning of behaviors and social influence of opinions in various contexts.\nThe goal is to build up a repertoire of agent-based modeling techniques for incorporating different assumptions about how social learning or influence work, whether group structure is important to these processes, and for modeling social network structure. This repertoire can then be applied to sustainability contexts of interest to understand how different sustainability intervention strategies, such as who should learn about sustainable adaptations first in an educational intervention or how best to assist stakeholder deliberations to reduce opinion polarization that can derail collective adaptation. To choose model components wisely requires an understanding of elements of sustainability, cognitive and social science, network science, and software engineering.\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals help us focus and organize our work by providing concrete goals for evaluating progress towards sustainable development for all Figure 1.5. These goals include targets for institutional development that promotes basic conditions for human thriving (justice, equality, education, public health, and no poverty) so as to assemble and enable a critical mass of people to participate bringing about sustainable development. People cannot participate in sustainability if they suffer in poverty, from illness, or subjugation by authoritarians–all but the most zealous environmental defenders will fight on when these basic needs are unmet. Since progress has been slower than necessary.\nSustainability, then, has several different dimensions, all of which contribute to climate action and environmental protection. I have organized these goals into a coding system called the vIBE system: vibrant Institutions support Basic human needs of people who protect the Environment. All 17 goals and the organization system are illustrated in Figure 1.5. Organizing and connecting our work to has two benefits. First, it helps us identify which cognitive and social factors are at work in different sustainability foci. Second, it expands the corpus of existing research on which we draw to consolidate our social and cognitive theories of behavior change that we will apply to sustainability interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be organized into groups for vibrant Institutions (Group I) that provide Basic needs (Group B) required for people to actively work towards Environmental and Ecological protection (Group E)–we dub this the vIBE coding of the sustainable development goals.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1 Plan\nIn the rest of the course, we will develop our knowledge of computational social science and agent-based modeling techniques to enable you to pursue independent projects designing sustainability interventions or more general studies of how different cognitive and social factors affect the diffusion of adaptations.\nHere is a plan for the following chapters (and the remaining ten-week course):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nReal-world sustainability application\nCognitive or social science background and theory\nvIBE code sustainable development goals\nAssociated problem set\n\n\n\n\nDiffusion of adaptations in toy network models\n\nSustainable agricultural practices (Dwyer2022?; Kling et al. 2024)\n\n\n\nHealth education in rural Honduras (Airoldi and Christakis 2024)\nPreventative health behaviors such as vaccinations and masking (Fast et al. 2015; Paul E.

    "text": "One of the most overwhelming challenges for me as a researcher is writing research papers. I’ve been lucky to learn from excellent teachers and currently have a network of mentors I can turn to for help. Still, writing is an inherently solitary endeavor that is in many ways an exploration, the building of a map of information. When we present our scientific work, much of the information already exists in the form of previous work on which we build. In terms of information volume, the work we present in scientific papers is relatively miniscule compared to the vast wealth of science amassed up to today. However, our work we want to write is new to the world, including ourselves even though we created it. This means that we need to take special care to explain\nGood scientific writing (1) reviews previous work in the context of our project goals; (2) notes the location of some dark, foggy corners of our current understanding to motivate new work we intend to present to the reader; (3) presents the model in sufficient detail so the reader can re-produce the model and analysis; (4) presents results by contextualizing them in terms of our research questions and explains why the model outcomes emerged as they did; and finally, (5) reviews the findings, the model that produced them, the research questions that motivated the model, the impact of the findings for the research questions and more broadly for social behavior/sustainability, for social behavioral sciences, and even for our general understanding of the universe, as appropriate.\nScientific papers share a structure that we will use as a template so one need not start from scratch. The structure is known as either the IMAD or IMRaD structure, which stands for the major section headings of the papers indicating the major logical divisions of the presentation of social behavior modeling studies: either the Introduction, Model, Analysis, Discussion structure or the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion structure.\nEach of these major divisions contain standard types of information about the study.
